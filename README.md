# Just (Video) Player

Android video player based on [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)

It uses ExoPlayer's ``extension-ffmpeg`` with [all its audio formats](https://exoplayer.dev/supported-formats.html#ffmpeg-extension) enabled (it can handle even special formats like AC3, EAC3, DTS, DTS HD, TrueHD etc.).

It properly synces audio with video track when using Bluetooth earphones/speaker. (I was not able to find any other nice ExoPlayer based video player so I created this one.)

Player features:

 * Audio/subtitle track selection
 * Playback speed control
 * Horizontal swipe to quickly seek
 * Vertical swipe to change brightness (left) / volume (right)
 * PiP (Picture in Picture) on Android 8 or higher
 * Resize (fit/crop)
 * No ads, tracking or even the Internet permission

To load an external (non-embedded) subtitles, long press the file open action in the bottom bar.
